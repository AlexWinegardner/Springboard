## Pipenv

The `Pipefile` has all the necessary python dependencies and requirements. So you can use [Pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if you want to create a separate python environment for this project. 

To install pipenv see [here](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today).

To create the env and install the required libraries (once you have pipenv installed) you can just do:
```
pipenv install
```

Then to activate the env and launch jupyter from this env you can do something like the below two commands:
```
pipenv shell
jupyter lab
```
